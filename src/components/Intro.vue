          I'm a computer science graduate and love working in designing and
          building high-performance backbone and wireless networks with
          particular regard to user experiences.

          During my study I noticed how well interaction design concepts can be
          applied to designing and operating large-scale network
          infrastructureâ€”and how often these were missing in existing systems.

          I started working at the
          <a target="_blank" href="https://hci.rwth-aachen.de"
            >Media Computing Group at RWTH Aachen University</a
          >
          in 2013 where we focused on the interaction design every system has to
          get right when interacting with users in the real world.

          While I have been working at at a
          <a target="_blank" href="https://ramnet.de/links/netzstatus"
            >small-scale internet provider</a
          >
          since 2014, for my masters thesis I shifted my focus towards creating
          great user experiences in mobile and web applications and how this can
          be accomplished in a user-centered approach.
